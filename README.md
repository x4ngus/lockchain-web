# LockChain Web

Static landing page for the **LockChain ZFS** project.

- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Dark, cyberpunk-adjacent theme to sit next to the Rust/Iced UI
- Single-page marketing/information site:
  - Hero (project ambition & value)
  - Overview
  - Architecture
  - Story / philosophy
  - Roadmap / work-in-progress
  - Links to GitHub & docs

This site does **not** expose any functional UI for LockChain itself. It is informational only.
